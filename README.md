# Discrepancy Scaling
Discrepancy Scaling is a fast method for unsupervised anomaly detection and localization. This repository will house the official implementation of the method, presented in the paper "Discrepancy Scaling for Fast Unsupervised
Anomaly Localization".

## The state of this repository
We are currently refactoring our research code for better legibility and usability. A working implementation of Discrepancy Scaling should be available on this repo by late May 2023. Stay tuned!
